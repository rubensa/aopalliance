    <div class=title>AOP Alliance (Java/J2EE AOP standards)</div>

    <h1>What is AOP Alliance?</h1>

    <p>We believe that Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) offers a better
    solution to many problems than do existing technologies such as
    EJB. The AOP Alliance aims to ensure interoperability between
    Java/J2EE AOP implementations to build a larger AOP community.
    
    <p>AOP Alliance focusses on defining standard specifications of a
    set of useful or mandatory componants or interfacers for
    aspect-oriented systems.

    <p>The first idea is to have a common set of abstract components
    specifications, distributed under a Public Domain licence, that
    will help all the projets to communicate and reuse components
    coming from other projects.

    <p>The second idea is to provide a set of standard implementation
    for core mecanisms that are needed when building AO systems
    (e.g. interception mechanisms, generic class loading mecanisms).

    <p>The AOP Alliance project is a joint project between several software
    engineering people who are interested in AOP or some other
    related projects.

    <h1>Motiviations</h1>

    <p>AOP is a new programming paradigm and set of techniques that
    allows better separation and modularization of concerns.

    <p>Several projects now provide AOP-related techniques such as
    generic proxies, interceptors, or bytecode translators. Thus, we
    can see a lot of new components or systems arising to perform
    AOP or AOP-releated stuffs:

    <ul>
      <li>
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/">AspectJ</a>: an AO
      source-level weaver. New Language.
      </li><li>
	<a href="http://aspectwerkz.sourceforge.net/">AspectWerkz</a>: an AO
	framework (bytecode-level dynamic weaver+configuration).
      </li><li>
	<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">BCEL</a>: a bytecode
      translator.
      </li><li>
	<a href="http://jac.aopsys.com">JAC</a>: an AO middleware
      (bytecode-level dynamic weaver+configuration+aspects). Framework.
       </li><li>
	<a
      href="http://www.csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~chiba/javassist/">Javassist</a>:
      a bytecode translator with a high-level API.
       </li><li>
	<a
      href="http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=html&op=userdisplay&id=developers/projects/jboss/aop">JBoss-AOP</a>:
      interception and metadata-based AO framework.
       </li><li>
	<a
      href="http://javalab.cs.uni-bonn.de/research/jmangler/">JMangler</a>:
      a bytecode translator with a composition framework for translations.
       </li><li>
	<a href="http://nanning.sf.net">Nanning</a>: an AO weaver (framework).
       </li><li>
	<a href="http://prose.ethz.ch/">Prose</a>: an AO
      bytecode-level dynamic weaver (framework).
       </li><li>
	... and many others (<a
      href="mailto:renaud@aopsys.com">email me</a> to add a new one)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>All these projects have their onw goals and
      speficities. However, several common basic components are still
      usefull (and sometimes required) to build a full AO system. For
      instance, a component that is able to add metadata on the base
      components, a component that is able to perform code translation
      in order to advice the classes, a weaver component, a
      configuration component, and so on.
      
    <p>To us, it would be great to be able to reuse different
      components coming from different projects to build a full AO
      system, and for three main reasons.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Firstly, several components
      already exist and it would be stupid to rebuild them.</li>

      <li>Secondly,
      various implementation of the same component may be useful and be
      more-or-less suited depending on the environement. For instance:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    the program tranformation can be done at a bytecode or a
	    the source-code level, at compile or at run time, using an
	    interception or a code insertion mechanism depending on
	    the implementation of the component that translates the
	    base program, </li><li> the weaver may be used within a
	    standard Java context or within an EJB context, which may
	    imply some implementation differencies
	  </li>
	</ul>
      <li>
	Thirdly, having common interfaces and components
	would help in reusing aspects (for instance, we could imagine to
	reuse a JAC or a JBoss aspect in other contexts than JAC or
	JBoss and with other weavers -- e.g. Prose, Nanning, or
	AspectWerkz weavers).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For these reasons, we think that a standarization of the
    interfaces of the aspect-oriented components would be great and
    will bring great simplifications for the entire AOSD community,
    but also for all the communities that will to use AOP in a close
    future (e.g. JBoss).
